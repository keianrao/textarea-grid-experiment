An idea I had - using modern HTML/CSS/JS to make a crude implementation of a certain useful program[1].

![Demo. There is a grid of text areas, with tiny fonts, opened "fullscreen" using the mouse and text pasted into them. Then a return to the grid, showing text from every text area at once.](Recording.gif)

This program has no keyboard controls - so it's not very accessible..

This program was tested with Firefox and Chromium. Its use of CSS grid might make it not work very well in other browser engines, especially really old ones.

[1] The elusive program is a programming tool, that lets you have a broad view of a large group of source code files at once. I've heard of several people wanting it, but there isn't really an implementation for it. It's a bit difficult to pull off, it's not very useful for screens that aren't large.. and it has questionable advantage over text editors that can flip through files quickly.
